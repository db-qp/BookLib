# BookLib

This program simulates a library. A user can load a file (if formatted properly) with a number of books and their details. A user can add a book to the
library, display the books that are currently in the library, and change the amount of copies a book has. Once the user quits out of the program, the
current library will be saved to the file ("list.txt").
